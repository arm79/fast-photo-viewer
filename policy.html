                </p>
                <p>
                The information we collect may be collected directly by us, or it may be collected by a third-party website hosting provider, or another third-party service provider, on our behalf.

Some examples of this type of information include information that you electronically submit when you contact us with questions, information that you post on blogs, discussion forums or other community posting and social networking areas on our Site, information that you electronically submit when you complete an online registration form to access and use certain features of our Site, and information contained in search requests or questions that you submit to the Site.
